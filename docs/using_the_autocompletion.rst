As soon as you start typing a context box will popup that gives you suggestions.

Normally the context box opens and closes automatically but you can also do this
manually:

    - **Open:** *shift ESC*
    - **Close:** *ESC* or clicking somewhere else in the text editor

Navigation through the context box:

    - *Arrow Up/Down:* Move the selected index in the arrow-direction.
    - *Page Up/Down:* Same as arrow keys but skips a fixed a few items.
    - *Home/End:* Jump to the first or last element.
    - *Wheel Up/Down:* Move the selected index in the rotation direction.
                       Only works when the mouse is on top of the context box.
