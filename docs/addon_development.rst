Addon Development
*****************

Code Autocomplete comes with several tools which simplify addon development
inside of Blender a lot. Blender itself is not good for it, because it is hard to
manage multiple files and to register everything correctly. This addon tries to
overcome these difficulties by providing templates and operators to quickly create,
extend and export code.

The Addon Development tools only work with addons which have their own folders
(not single-file addons, these can be created without Code Autocomplete).

Before you can start coding you have to choose which addon you want to work on.
You can either work on an existing one or create a completely new one.
To select one that already exist you can write its name in the corresponding field
or click on the eyedropper next to it to get a list of all installed multi-file addons.

Creating a new Addon
====================

To start a new addon you have to write the name it should have in the text box.
Code Autocomplete will check automatically if the addon already exists and decides
wether it should give you the options to create a new one or not. It will also
not allow you to use addon names that may become problematic later.

If you inserted a 'incorrect' addon name, a button to correct this name appears.
Basically this operator replaces spaces with underscores and makes everything
lower case (this is not the name the end user will see, and changing it later is easy).

Once you have a correct name you get a new button to finally create the addon folder.
You get two template options:

    - Basic:
        This template contains only the minimum code that is needed to have a valid addon.
        There is the *bl_info* property as well as the *register* and *unregister* functions.

    - Multi-File:
        This (recommended) addon template contains the same as *Basic*, but beside that
        there is a license and code that simplifies loading the different files of your
        addon. The loading code is the same that imports other addons like *Code Autocomplete*
        itself, but also the *Animation Nodes* addon.

As soon as you select a template the addon folder will be created.
A new panel called *Addon Files* appears and the *__init__.py* file that
is the heart of every addon is displayed in the text editor.

Working on an Addon
===================

Addon Files Panel
-----------------

This panel gives you access to all the files and directories in your addon.
You can create, open, rename and delete files. For more file manipulations you
should open the addon folder in your default file browser using the folder icon.

The *Save All Files* operator looks which files you have currently opened and will
save them. When you *Run* the addon this will happen as well.

Addon Development Panel
-----------------------

When you click onthe *Run Addon* button all files will be saved first.
Then your addon will be unregistered (if it has been registered before), reloaded
and registered again. You should not use the normal *Run Script* button at the
bottom.

From time to time it is useful to *Restart Blender* to have a clean working
environment, so that you are not effected by earlier code executions.

When your addon is in a state so that you want to share it, the *Export as Zip*
operator becomes very handy. After clicking you have to choose an output location
and name. Now you complete addon will be packed in to a zip file that others can
install.
